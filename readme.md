# Gisty
A naive clone of github's [gists](https://gist.github.com/), created to act as standard guidelines when developing any Go app.




## 1. Basic Setup
* The 3 essential components:
  * #1 **Handler**: similar to Controllers(for MVC guys)
    * responsible for executing your application logic and for writing HTTP response headers and bodies. 

  * #2 **Servemux**: i.e. Router(for MVC guys)
    * stores a mapping between urls & the corresponding handlers.
  * #3 **Web Server**: to listen for incoming requests 
    * Go lets you make it as part of your application itself(unlike external 3rd-party server like Nginx or Apache.)
